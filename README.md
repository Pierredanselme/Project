# Project

# Context :

All Human have DNA that can mutate into different things and also create diseases. Some of the disease are genetic and can be identify in the DNA of the desired person. 
However, if we can identify a specific sequence of a specific disease and then add it on the program; we can compare the sequence with the DNA of a person, to see if this person have the disease. 
In addition, diseases can be transcribed into RNA and then protein, so we can also search for specific sequence in the RNA of the person.
I think it is a good way to use all the notions that we study and to add more like dictionary etc.. It is also link to my courses in the Tec like biology.

#Algorithm :

  INTPUT
    - Specific sequence of a disease A (DNA) /
    - Specific sequence of a disease B (RNA) /
    - The DNA sequence of the person /
    - A dictionary that convert DNA into RNA

  PROCESS
    - Put into variable A and B the specific sequence of this diseases /
    - Ask for the DNA sequence of the "patient" /
    - Compare the DNA sequence of the patient with the sequence A  /
    - Return if the patient have the disease A /
    - Convert DNA into RNA  /
    - Compare the RNA sequence of the patient with the sequence B /
    - Return of the patient have the disease B
    
  OUTPUT
    - True/False for the disease A /
    - True/False for the disease B
