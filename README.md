# Project

# Context :

All Human have DNA that can mutate into different things and also create diseases. Some of the disease are genetic and can be identify in the DNA of the desired person. 
However, if we can identify a specific sequence of a specific disease and then add it on the program; we can compare the sequence with the DNA of a person, to see if this person have the disease. 
In addition, diseases can be transcribed into RNA and then protein, so we can also search for specific sequence in the RNA of the person.
